All analytic code are in data_analytic. Data1 is the code for data set 1, and data2 for data set 2. 

For both data sets, the MR code for cleaning can be ran by <./test.sh>. In test.sh, the input file, hdfs directory containing the data, and the output folder (in the same directory as data) can be specified. The queries used to get win rate data based on specific features are available in data1/iteration2.hql for data set 1 and data2/hive_queries for data set 2. All tables are stored as external tables in Hive. 

For data1, the code is available in the analytic2 folder. The other folder is a test program for writing the MR code in analytic2.

The folder hero_proc in data2 is a small program used to generate the csv file for each hero's name and id. The instructions are available in the folder's README.
