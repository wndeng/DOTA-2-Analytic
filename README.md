# DOTA 2 Analytic

This is a big data analytic project, done in collaboration with Yang Song, to explore factors that contribute to DOTA 2 win rate. The factors are extracted from match data collected by YASP (http://academictorrents.com/details/5c5deeb6cfe1c944044367d2e7465fd8bd2f4acf). ETL and Profiling are done through Hadoop MapReduce, and analytic Hive queries. Results are available in ![our paper](https://github.com/wndeng/DOTA-2-Analytic/blob/master/Paper.pdf).
